# Admin Account Setup Guide

This guide explains how to create a real admin user in Supabase Cloud for the Plateau State Polytechnic Result Hub.

## Overview

The admin account is created using Supabase's authentication system. This ensures that:
- The admin user is a real authenticated user in Supabase Cloud
- Password security is handled by Supabase
- Admin sessions are properly managed
- Admin can access all administrative features

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the admin account, you need:

1. **Supabase Project Access**: Access to your Supabase project dashboard
2. **Service Role Key**: Your Supabase service role key (not the anon key)

## Getting Your Service Role Key

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xglnamczjtdzsblkelhz
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **API**
3. Find the **service_role** key in the **Project API keys** section
4. Copy this key (it starts with `eyJ...`)

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Keep this key secure! Never commit it to version control or share it publicly.

## Method 1: Using the Setup Script (Recommended)

The easiest way to create the admin account is using our automated script.

### Steps:

1. **Set the environment variable** for the service role key:

   ```bash
   # On Linux/Mac:
   export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your_service_role_key_here"
   
   # On Windows (Command Prompt):
   set SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
   
   # On Windows (PowerShell):
   $env:SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your_service_role_key_here"
   ```

2. **Run the setup script**:

   ```bash
   npm run setup-admin
   ```

3. **Wait for confirmation**:
   The script will output the admin credentials and confirm successful setup:
   ```
   üéâ Admin user successfully created in Supabase Cloud!
   
   üîë Login Credentials:
      Email: admin@plasu.edu.ng
      Password: Admin123456
   ```

4. **Login to test**:
   - Navigate to the admin login page
   - Use the credentials shown above
   - You should be able to access the admin dashboard

## Method 2: Manual Setup via Supabase Dashboard

If you prefer to set up the admin manually:

### Step 1: Create Auth User

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Users**
3. Click **Add user** ‚Üí **Create new user**
4. Fill in:
   - **Email**: `admin@plasu.edu.ng`
   - **Password**: `Admin123456` (or your preferred password)
   - Check **Auto Confirm User** 
5. Click **Create user**
6. Copy the user's UUID (you'll need this in the next step)

### Step 2: Add Admin Record

1. Navigate to **Table Editor** ‚Üí **admins** table
2. Click **Insert** ‚Üí **Insert row**
3. Fill in:
   - **user_id**: Paste the UUID from Step 1
   - **email**: `admin@plasu.edu.ng`
   - **first_name**: `System`
   - **last_name**: `Administrator`
   - **staff_id**: `ADMIN001`
   - **department**: `Computer Science`
   - **role**: `Super Admin`
4. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Verify Setup

1. Go to the admin login page of your application
2. Login with:
   - Email: `admin@plasu.edu.ng`
   - Password: The password you set in Step 1
3. You should be able to access the admin dashboard

## Default Admin Credentials

After setup, the default admin credentials are:

- **Email**: `admin@plasu.edu.ng`
- **Password**: `Admin123456`
- **Name**: System Administrator
- **Staff ID**: ADMIN001
- **Department**: Computer Science

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Change the default password after first login!

## Changing the Admin Password

### Via Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Users**
2. Find the admin user (`admin@plasu.edu.ng`)
3. Click on the user
4. Click **Reset Password** or use **Send Magic Link**

### Programmatically:

You can also use Supabase's password reset flow:
1. Navigate to the admin login page
2. Click "Forgot Password" (if implemented)
3. Follow the reset instructions

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Missing required environment variables"

**Solution**: Make sure you've set the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` environment variable before running the script.

### Error: "Admin user already exists"

**Solution**: This is normal if you've already run the setup. The script will skip creating duplicate users.

### Error: "You are not authorized to access the admin panel"

**Possible causes**:
1. The admin record wasn't created in the `admins` table
2. The email doesn't match between auth.users and public.admins
3. RLS policies are blocking access

**Solution**: 
- Check that the admin record exists in the `admins` table
- Verify the `user_id` matches the auth user's UUID
- Check the migration was applied: `20251014020900_setup_real_admin.sql`

### Can't login after setup

**Solution**:
1. Verify the auth user was created:
   - Go to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Users** in Supabase dashboard
   - Look for `admin@plasu.edu.ng`

2. Verify the admin record exists:
   - Go to **Table Editor** ‚Üí **admins**
   - Look for the admin email
   - Check that `user_id` is not null

3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try clearing browser cache/cookies

## Database Migrations

The following migration files set up the admin infrastructure:

1. `20251014014856_533ae60a-d728-43cb-a7d6-cc59b8450ba6.sql` - Creates the base tables
2. `20251014020900_setup_real_admin.sql` - Sets up admin permissions and policies
3. `20251015003418_restrict_admin_table_access.sql` - **Security fix**: Adds restrictive RLS policies to prevent non-admin users from accessing admin records

Make sure these migrations have been applied to your Supabase project.

**Security Note**: The latest migration adds comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policies to prevent students and other non-admin users from accessing admin contact information. See [docs/SECURITY_FIX_ADMIN_RLS.md](docs/SECURITY_FIX_ADMIN_RLS.md) for details.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Change the default password** immediately after first login
2. **Never commit** the service role key to version control
3. **Use strong passwords** for admin accounts
4. **Limit admin access** to authorized personnel only
5. **Monitor admin activity** through Supabase logs
6. **Enable MFA** (Multi-Factor Authentication) for admin accounts when available
7. **RLS Policies**: The admins table is protected with restrictive Row Level Security policies that prevent non-admin users from accessing admin data. See [SECURITY_FIX_ADMIN_RLS.md](docs/SECURITY_FIX_ADMIN_RLS.md) for details.

## Adding Additional Admins

To add more admin users:

1. Create a new auth user in Supabase (see Method 2, Step 1)
2. Add their record to the `admins` table (see Method 2, Step 2)
3. Provide them with their credentials securely

Or modify the `scripts/create-admin.js` script to create additional admins.

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the Supabase logs in your dashboard
2. Verify all migrations have been applied
3. Check that RLS policies allow admin access
4. Review the browser console for error messages
